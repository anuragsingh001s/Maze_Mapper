[PROJECT LIVE DEMO](mazemapper.netlify.app)

This project is hosted on netlify app (mazemapper.netlify.app)

MazeApp is a visual Webapp designed to help you understand and visualize graph algorithms. This application demonstrates how Simplified Breadth-First Search (SBFS) and Bidirectional Search (BDS) algorithms find paths from a start node to a target node in a grid environment.
